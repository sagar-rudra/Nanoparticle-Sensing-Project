## Limitations and observations
Although functionalized AgNPs were successfully synthesized and characterized, no significant color change
was observed during milk spoilage testing.

Possible reasons include:
- Aggregation of nanoparticles in complex milk matrices
- Protein interactions inhibiting analyte–nanoparticle binding
- Insufficient specificity of functional groups toward spoilage markers

These observations highlight the challenges of nanoparticle-based sensing in real food samples and indicate
directions for future optimization.
