# Project Summary – Silver Nanoparticles for Milk Spoilage Detection

This document provides a concise technical summary of the project thesis on the synthesis,
functionalization, and characterization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) for potential
application in milk spoilage detection.

The focus of this project was experimental design, material characterization, and
critical evaluation of sensing feasibility rather than software development.

---

## Objective
The objective of this project was to investigate whether functionalized silver nanoparticles
could be used as a colorimetric sensing platform for detecting milk spoilage by monitoring
chemical changes associated with microbial activity.

---

## Methodology Overview

### Nanoparticle synthesis
Silver nanoparticles were synthesized using a chemical reduction method.
Sodium borohydride and trisodium citrate were used as reducing and stabilizing agents
to obtain colloidal AgNPs with nanoscale dimensions.

### Surface functionalization
Cysteamine hydrochloride was used to functionalize the surface of AgNPs.
The functionalization aimed to enhance interaction between nanoparticles and spoilage
markers such as lactic acid produced during milk degradation.

## Characterization Techniques

The synthesized and functionalized nanoparticles were characterized using:

- **UV–Visible Spectroscopy**  
  To confirm nanoparticle formation through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks.

- **Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)**  
  To analyze particle size distribution and aggregation behavior.

- **Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)**  
  To observe particle morphology and validate nanoscale dimensions.

These techniques were used to verify successful synthesis and assess stability.

## Application Testing

Milk samples at different stages (fresh, pre-spoiled, and spoiled) were prepared.
Functionalized AgNPs were introduced to the samples to evaluate potential colorimetric
changes associated with spoilage.

Visual inspection and comparative analysis were performed to assess sensing behavior.

## Results and Observations

- Successful synthesis and functionalization of AgNPs were confirmed through
  UV–Vis, DLS, and SEM characterization.
- Stable colloidal nanoparticles were obtained under controlled conditions.
- No significant or consistent color change was observed during milk spoilage testing.

## Limitations and Analysis

The absence of a strong colorimetric response highlights several practical challenges:

- Interaction of milk proteins and fats with nanoparticles affecting sensitivity
- Aggregation effects in complex biological matrices
- Limited specificity of functional groups toward spoilage markers
- Reduced signal contrast under real sample conditions

These results emphasize the difficulty of translating nanoparticle-based sensing
from controlled environments to real food systems.
